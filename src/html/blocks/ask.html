            Have you ever wondered what permanent makeup artists do?
          </p>
          <p class="ask__item-body-text">
            Well, they are called artists for an excellent reason. Permanent
            makeup's popularity is growing worldwide, and its usefulness is the
            reason for it. It is particularly beneficial for people who like to
            save time in the mornings, preparing for work or save money buying
            an endless amount of makeup products and for the people who have
            trouble applying makeup for different reasons, including tremors,
            arthritis or multiple sclerosis. Some people also have allergic
            reactions to makeup and want to avoid it. Permanent makeup artists,
            often referred to as PMU artists, are skilled professionals
            specializing in cosmetic tattooing techniques. Their expertise
            involves enhancing facial features through the application of
            permanent pigmentation. These artists meticulously apply pigments to
            create long-lasting eyebrow, eyeliner, and lip enhancements,
            offering clients a semi-permanent solution for a flawless and
            effortless everyday look.

            ​By learning to do permanent makeup, you can change lives to so many
            people, to a certain extent. So, as a permanent makeup artist, you
            cannot save a life, but you can definitely improve it. You can add
            color to somebody's lips, making them seem fuller, offer someone an
            opportunity to get beautiful eyebrows, lift somebody's eyes by
            applying permanent eyeliner... But the changes go even further. You
            can offer areola tattooing to a breast cancer patient after they had
            a mastectomy. Can you imagine how empowered that person might feel
            afterward? Permanent makeup artists have a unique ability to bring a
            smile to someone's faces. You can restore someone's confidence and
            make someone feel special and more attractive by means of permanent
            makeup. Permanent makeup artists have transformed the beauty
            industry, and they keep transforming people's lives.
